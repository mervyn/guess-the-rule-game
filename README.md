## Development

### Install development dependencies
Before you begin development, you will need to install the required node
modules and bower components. To do so, open a terminal window in the
project directory and run the following commands.
```
npm install
bower install
```

## Building

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
